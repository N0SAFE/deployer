# Universal Deployment Platform: Complete Project Overview

## Executive Summary

The Universal Deployment Platform transforms the existing Next.js + NestJS monorepo template into a comprehensive self-hosted deployment solution. This platform consolidates multiple deployment strategies on Virtual Private Servers (VPS), offering the simplicity of modern SaaS platforms with the control and cost-effectiveness of self-hosting.

## Product Vision

### Core Problem
Developers face a choice between expensive SaaS deployment platforms (Vercel, Netlify, Render) with vendor lock-in and costly pricing, or complex self-hosted solutions (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) requiring significant DevOps expertise.

### Solution
A middle-ground platform that provides:
- **SaaS-like Simplicity**: One-click deployments, preview environments, intuitive dashboard
- **Self-Hosted Control**: Complete data ownership, predictable costs, no vendor lock-in
- **Universal Support**: Works with any Git platform, custom deployment methods
- **Multi-Service Management**: Intelligent dependency handling between services

## Core Features & Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Source Deployment Support
- **GitHub Integration**: Repository webhooks, branch deployments, PR previews
- **GitLab Integration**: CI/CD integration, merge request previews  
- **Generic Git Support**: Any Git repository with authentication
- **File Upload Deployments**: Zip file uploads with build configuration
- **Custom Methods**: Extensible plugin system (Dokku-style teapot functionality)

### 2. Intelligent Preview Deployment System
- **Automatic Subdomain Generation**: Smart naming conventions based on branches/PRs
- **Base Domain Configuration**: User-configurable domain for preview environments
- **Environment Variable Management**: Shared globals with preview-specific overrides
- **Webhook-Triggered Deployments**: Automatic preview creation on code changes
- **SSL Certificate Automation**: Automatic HTTPS for all preview environments

### 3. Multi-Service Project Orchestration
