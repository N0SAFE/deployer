i wan you to create a new way to  send update to the client (it should be a new nestjs service that should send update to all the client)) these update should be done for a lot of things and after this i want you to have a clear graph with node visual like n8n but with our own node explorer that tell where tis the actual steps  and what are next. the progress should also handle  percent progress like 80% progress in deploying the app or 20% building the app and so the dot should be put 20% up the bar to the next point 
so you should think in the first place as own to create this graph visual in a new package with how to manage the state and the object things and after this you should think of what are the real steps for each app
