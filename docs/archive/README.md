# Documentation Archive

This directory contains **historical documentation** that has been completed, superseded, or is no longer actively maintained.

## Purpose

The archive serves as a reference for:
- **Completed Implementation Summaries**: Documents tracking finished features and milestones
- **Bug Fix Records**: Historical fixes that are now part of the main codebase
- **Obsolete Implementations**: Implementation guides superseded by newer approaches
- **Legacy Features**: Features that have been replaced or significantly refactored
