# Active Context: Universal Deployment Platform Development

## Current Focus
Building the core deployment engine with Traefik domain management integration. Currently implementing the fundamental services for Docker orchestration, Git operations, deployment management, and automatic domain registration.

## Recent Progress
1. **Traefik Service Implementation**: Created comprehensive TraefikService for dynamic domain management and SSL certificate provisioning
2. **Service Integration**: Updated ServicesModule to register all deployment services including TraefikService
3. **Domain Architecture**: Designed automatic subdomain generation system for preview environments 
4. **Memory Bank Updates**: Enhanced system patterns with Traefik integration architecture

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Update Deployment Processor**: Integrate TraefikService with deployment job processing for automatic domain registration
2. **Deploy Integration**: Update DeploymentService to use TraefikService for domain management during deployments
3. **Environment Variables**: Add Traefik-specific configuration to environment setup
4. **Docker Integration**: Update DockerService to generate appropriate Traefik labels for containers

## Recent Implementation Details

### Traefik Integration Pattern
- **Dynamic Service Discovery**: Automatic container registration with domain routing using Docker labels
- **SSL Certificate Management**: Automatic Let's Encrypt certificate provisioning via Traefik
- **Subdomain Generation**: Intelligent naming conventions for production, staging, and preview environments
- **Configuration Management**: YAML-based dynamic configuration files for route management

### Service Architecture Updates
- **TraefikService**: Handles domain registration, subdomain generation, and route configuration
- **Enhanced DockerService**: Ready for Traefik label integration
- **DeploymentService**: Foundation for deployment orchestration with domain management
- **ServicesModule**: All services registered for dependency injection

## Current Technical Environment
- **Application Status**: ✅ Running successfully with all services loaded
- **Database**: ✅ PostgreSQL running with migrations applied
- **Services**: ✅ Docker, Git, Deployment, and Traefik services implemented
- **Dependencies**: ✅ js-yaml added for Traefik YAML configuration generation

## Active Considerations

### Domain Management Strategy
- **Base Domain Configuration**: Environment variable `DEPLOYER_BASE_DOMAIN` for customization
- **Subdomain Patterns**: 
  - Production: `project-service.domain.com`
  - Staging: `project-service-staging.domain.com`
  - Preview: `project-service-{branch|pr|custom}.domain.com`
- **SSL/TLS**: Automatic certificate generation in production environments

### Container Orchestration Integration
- **Traefik Labels**: Automatic generation based on deployment configuration
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic registration and deregistration of services
- **Health Monitoring**: Integration with Traefik health checks
- **Load Balancing**: Automatic load balancer configuration for deployed services

## Implementation Patterns Being Used

### Domain Management Pattern
```typescript
// Automatic subdomain generation with sanitization
const subdomain = traefikService.generateSubdomain({
  projectName: 'my-app',
  serviceName: 'api',
  environment: 'preview',
  branch: 'feature/new-auth'
});
// Result: my-app-api-feature-new-auth.domain.com
```

### Service Registration Pattern
```typescript
// Automatic Traefik configuration generation
await traefikService.registerDeployment({
  subdomain: 'my-app-api-preview',
  baseDomain: 'deploy.example.com',
  projectId: 'proj_123',
  serviceId: 'svc_456', 
  deploymentId: 'dep_789',
  port: 3000,
  containerId: 'container_abc'
});
```

## Key Architectural Decisions Made

### 1. **Traefik Integration Method**
- **Chosen**: Dynamic file-based configuration with Docker labels
- **Rationale**: Provides maximum flexibility and doesn't require Traefik restarts
- **Alternative Considered**: Direct Docker socket integration (more complex setup)

### 2. **Domain Strategy**  
- **Chosen**: Automatic subdomain generation with sanitization
- **Rationale**: Predictable, scalable, and user-friendly naming
- **Alternative Considered**: Random subdomain generation (less intuitive)

### 3. **SSL Certificate Management**
- **Chosen**: Traefik with Let's Encrypt integration
- **Rationale**: Automatic certificate provisioning and renewal
- **Alternative Considered**: Manual certificate management (maintenance overhead)

### 4. **Configuration Storage**
- **Chosen**: File-based YAML configuration with dynamic updates
- **Rationale**: Human-readable, version-controllable, and easy to debug
- **Alternative Considered**: Database-stored configuration (more complex)

## Immediate Technical Tasks

### Priority 1: Deployment Integration
1. **Update deployment processor** to call TraefikService during deployments
2. **Enhance DockerService** to generate Traefik labels automatically
3. **Test domain registration** with sample deployment

### Priority 2: Configuration Management
1. **Add Traefik environment variables** to environment template system
2. **Create Docker Compose integration** for Traefik service
3. **Document domain configuration** for users

### Priority 3: Error Handling & Monitoring
1. **Implement health checks** for Traefik service integration
2. **Add deployment rollback** with domain cleanup
3. **Create domain status monitoring** for deployment dashboard

## Current Environment Status
- **Development Setup**: ✅ Ready (all dependencies installed and services registered)
- **Traefik Integration**: ✅ Service implemented and ready for testing
- **Memory Bank**: ✅ Updated with Traefik architecture patterns
- **Next Phase Ready**: ✅ All foundation services available for deployment integration

**Ready to Continue Implementation**: ✅ All Traefik foundation complete, ready to integrate with deployment processor and test domain registration workflow.
