## Technical Decisions Made

### ✅ **Architecture Decisions**
1. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (extends existing setup)
2. **Job Processing**: Bull Queue with Redis for async deployments  
3. **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO WebSocket gateway
4. **Container Orchestration**: Start with Docker Compose, plan for Docker Swarm migration
5. **Reverse Proxy**: Traefik for automatic subdomain routing
6. **File Storage**: Local filesystem for self-hosted simplicity

### ✅ **Development Approach**
1. **Monorepo Pattern**: Extend existing Turborepo structure
2. **API-First**: ORPC contracts before implementation
3. **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Zod validation
4. **Testing Strategy**: Leverage existing Vitest setup
5. **Documentation**: Maintain existing documentation standards

## Outstanding Technical Decisions

### 🤔 **Container Orchestration**
**Options**: Docker Compose → Docker Swarm → Kubernetes
